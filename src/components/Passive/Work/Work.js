        Eternity Earn is $CRO miner rewards pool built on the Cronos Chain, the
        native blockchain of Crypro.com. When $CRO is deposited and locked into
        the decentralized application (Dapp), you will begin earning real-time
        rewards, up to 8% daily, in the form of $CRO that you can compound
        (reinvest) or claim (withdraw). There is no secondary token to purchase
        or stake, making Eternity Earn a simple way to participate in crypto
        DeFi.
